// if docker command take a lot of time (e.g. "docker ps" may take ~30 seconds)

I tryed, but this did not help:
- disable ipv6
- eliminate any virus protection software
- reinstall docker (Docker Desktop for Windows)

The solution that helped me (from this article )!
- execute command 
	nbtstat /n
	
	it print (on my computer)
	
	Name               Type         Status
